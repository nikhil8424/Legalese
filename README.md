# Legaleze Assistance Application

## Overview

The Legaleze Assistance Application is designed to simplify the management and comprehension of legal documents using advanced technologies such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The application enables legal professionals, clients, and law students to efficiently extract, analyze, and translate legal texts, making complex legal documents more accessible.

## Features

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** Convert physical and scanned legal documents into editable and searchable digital text.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Automatically identify and extract key clauses, names, dates, and other important elements from legal documents.
- **Automated Clause Identification:** Quickly locate and highlight key clauses within legal documents.
- **Document Identification:** Recognize and categorize different types of legal documents.
- **Language Translation:** Translate legal documents into multiple languages.
- **Plain Language Summaries:** Convert complex legal language into simplified summaries.

## System Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture that integrates OCR and NLP components to process legal documents efficiently. The system is designed to handle various input formats and provide users with multiple output options.

### Main Modules:
- **OCR Module:** Handles text extraction from PDF, JPG, and PNG files.
- **NLP Module:** Processes extracted text for key information.
- **User Interface:** Built using [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for a desktop interface or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for a web-based interface.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **User Interface:** Tkinter or Flask
- **Text Processing:** PyPDF2, pytesseract, and NLP libraries
- **Image Processing:** PIL (Pillow)
- **Development Tools:** Git, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
